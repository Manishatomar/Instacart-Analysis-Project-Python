# Instacart-Analysis-Python
I explored Instacart's sales data to identify hidden patterns that could optimize their market segmentation strategies. By conducting a comprehensive exploratory analysis using Python, I aimed to uncover insights that could significantly enhance their sales tactics. The insights from this analysis have the potential to redefine their approach for improved outcomes.
### Objectives
In this project, I assumed the role of an analyst for Instacart to explore sales patterns and customer behaviors. The objective was to uncover insights that would drive improved customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
### Context
Instacart, an online grocery platform with strong sales, sought to gain a deeper understanding of their sales patterns. My analysis is centered on identifying distinct customer segments and recommending targeted strategies to drive increased product sales.
### Key Questions
What are the peak order times and days?
When do customers tend to spend the most?
How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies?
Which product departments are most popular?
How do customer demographics and behaviors vary in terms of brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns?
### Data Source
The datasets used were:-
Customers
Orders
Orders_products_prior
Products
Departments
### Stakeholders
The insights derived from this analysis will cater to:
The Vice President of Marketing
The Senior Vice President of Sales
Instacart Customers
The goal is to align marketing strategies with customer preferences and uncover growth opportunities within Instacart's offerings.
### Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following supporting libraries:
Pandas: for data analysis
Numpy: for mathematical equations
Seaborn: for data visualizations
Matplotlib: for data visualizations
SciPy: for mathematical equations
### Folders
The project files are stored in following folder structure:
01 Project Management: Project brief
02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data which contain the original data frames and Prepared Data contain the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
04 Analysis: The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.
### Final Deliverable
For a comprehensive view of my findings and recommendations, please refer to the [Final Project PDF](). This analysis is not only about uncovering current trends but also about predicting future customer behaviors, thereby enabling Instacart to stay ahead in a competitive market.
