It could start with an abbreviation of the project name, a number that corresponds to the step you’re executing, and a name for that step. For example, if you were tasked with conducting consistency checks on your Instacart data, you could have two scripts with titles such as “1. IC Duplicates checks” and “2. IC Missing values checks.”\n",

    "Crosstabs in Python, similar to Excel's pivot tables, are useful for data checks. For example, in Instacart data, you found missing values in the \"days_since_prior_order\" column, likely due to first orders having no prior days. The head() and tail() functions support this, but a crosstab between \"days_since_prior_order\" and \"order_number\" would confirm it. If all missing values align with the first order, your hypothesis is validated. This crosstab can be created via the following code:"
